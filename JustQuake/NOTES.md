- You should now be able to use `cl.exe` to compile C.
- Install an editor of our choice.
> I use VS Code.
- Download and extract the latest release of the [RAD Debugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger?tab=readme-ov-file).
- Put the extracted folder whereever you prefer.
> I put mine under `C:\raddbg`.
- Copy the path of the folder that contains the `raddbg.exe` file and add it to your path.
