# vsQuake

This is a fork of the official [Quake](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake) source code repository.

In this repo, I've made a copy of the `WinQuake` folder called `vsQuake` in which I've tweaked the project to build and run in a VS Code development setup.

Please refer to the README in the `vsQuake` folder for more info. :-)
